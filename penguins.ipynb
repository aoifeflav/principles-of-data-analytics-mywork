    "    * Chinstrap \n",
    "    * Gentoo\n",

    "The culmen is the upper ridge of a penguin's bill. In the simplified penguins data, culmen length and depth are renamed as variables bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm for clarity. These variables measure, in millimeters, the dimensions of the penguin's bill. \n",

    "This variable measures the length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters.\n",
    "The most appropriate data type for this variable is integer, as all of the results within this section are positve, whole numbers. It would also be possible to use floats for this variable, howver it is preferable to use integers whenever possible due to the limited precision and loss of accuracy that an occur when using floats.\n",

    "### Variables 6: Body mass \n",
    "This variable measures the mass of each penguin in grams.\n",
    "Similar to Flipper length the most appropriate variable for this data type is also integer, due to all results being positive, whole numbers.\n",

    "### Variables 7: Sex\n",
    "This variable measures the sex of the penguins, whether they are male or female.\n",
    "The best data type for this variable, in this analysis, is a String. It would also be possible to use Booleans here, as there are only 2 options for the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables 8: Year\n",
