# Analysis of Palmer Penguins Dataset

## About This Project
This project aims to perform an analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset for the module Principles of Data Analytics at ATU. The dataset contains information about three species of penguins - Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo - observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.

## Use of this project
The analysis conducted in this project provides valuable insights into the characteristics and distribution of penguin species. It can be used by researchers, educators, and enthusiasts interested in penguin biology, ecology, or data analysis. (It can also be used by my lecturer to give me a good grade!)
